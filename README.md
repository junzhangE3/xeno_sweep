## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- `pip` (Python package installer).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xeno_sweep.git
   cd xeno_sweep
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Alternatively, install Pygame manually:*
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
4. **Ensure Assets are Present:**
   - Place the pixel font `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf` in the root directory. You can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
   - Place the `alien_head_icon.png` in the root directory.

### Running the Game

Execute the main Python script:
```bash
python xeno_sweep.py
```
(Or `python3 xeno_sweep.py` depending on your system setup)

## üéÆ How to Play

- **Objective:** Reveal all cells on the grid that do *not* contain a hidden Xeno-Pod (mine).
- **Numbers:** If you reveal a cell with a number, that number indicates how many Xeno-Pods are hidden in the 8 cells immediately surrounding it.
- **Flags/Beacons:** Use Spacebar to place a beacon on cells you suspect contain a Xeno-Pod. This helps you keep track and prevents accidental reveals.
- **Winning:** Successfully reveal all safe cells.
- **Losing:** Reveal a cell containing a Xeno-Pod.

### üïπÔ∏è Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move the selection cursor on the grid.
- **Enter / Return:** Reveal the selected cell.
- **Spacebar:** Place or remove a beacon (flag) on the selected cell.
- **R:** Rescan (reset) the game.

### üí° Future Enhancements (To-Do)
- Implement actual pixel art sprites for mines and flags.
- Add sound effects for various game actions (reveal, flag, explosion, win, lose).
- Include background music.
- Develop more varied NPC dialogue and reactions.
- Create different difficulty levels (grid size, mine density).
- Implement a proper main menu and settings screen.
- Add a high score system.
- More advanced NPC portrait/animations.

### üôè Acknowledgements
- The "Press Start 2P" font by CodeMan38.
- Pygame community for the excellent library.
- You, for playing the demo!
