## üéÆ How to Play

- **Objective:** Reveal all cells on the grid that do *not* contain a hidden Xeno-Pod (mine).
- **Numbers:** If you reveal a cell with a number, that number indicates how many Xeno-Pods are hidden in the 8 cells immediately surrounding it.
- **Flags/Beacons:** Use Spacebar to place a beacon on cells you suspect contain a Xeno-Pod. This helps you keep track and prevents accidental reveals.
- **Winning:** Successfully reveal all safe cells.
- **Losing:** Reveal a cell containing a Xeno-Pod.

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move the selection cursor on the grid.
- **Enter / Return:** Reveal the selected cell.
- **Spacebar:** Place or remove a beacon (flag) on the selected cell.
- **R:** Rescan (reset) the game.
